experiment with the dynamic-programming algorithm for sequence
alignment.

Derived classes shipped with this component include
C<Text::Align::Levenshtein> (see L<Text::Align::Levenshtein>) and
C<Text::Align::WagnerFischer> (see L<Text::Align::WagnerFischer>), which
are intended as more configurable replacements for C<Text::Levenshtein>
and C<Text::WagnerFischer>. (see L<Text::Align::background/Related Perl
modules> for a comparison among these).

Subclasses of this module can also use alternate weightings (rather
than the "exact equality" metric used by Levenshtein and
Wagner-Fischer), based on the specific characters (or elements) being
substituted, deleted or inserted.  See L<Text::Align::Covington> for
one of these.

It also can apply to calculate alignments between arrays, if array
references are provided.

A more detailed discussion of the background for this module is
available (see L<Text::Align::background>).

=head1 This is a contract class

This class is a contract class.  This means that:

=over

=item (1)

Clients of this class take the form of subclasses (descendants) of
this class. To fulfill the contract, they must provide implementations
of certain methods.

=item (2)

C<Text::Align> will not function if used directly:

  use Text::Align;
  # the next line will croak
  my $alignment = Text::Align->new(left => 'foo', right => 'bar');

since subclasses provide key pieces of the functionality. (A
contract's no good with only one signer.)

=item (3)

Subclasses fulfilling the contract will also receive the benefits of
the contract -- they will be granted the inherited methods from this
contract class (C<pairwise()>, C<cost()>, C<as_strings()>,
C<as_lists()>).

=back

=head2 Contract methods

The following methods must be provided to this module by any subclass
in order to fulfill the contract. If these methods do not exist, then
this module will not behave correctly - and will complain and probably
C<croak> at runtime.

=over

=item weighter()

This function is the core of any subclass of this one. The
C<weighter()> method will be called when comparing two elements, or
when considering skipping one. It will be called with two arguments,
representing the left and right elements to be compared.

The actual calls to the C<weighter()> will happen after the call to
C<init()> but before returning from C<new()>.

The C<weighter()> method will be called whenever the system is
considering a pair of tokens to align together (matches or
substitutions) or when one of the tokens should be skipped (insertion
or deletion). In the skip cases, one of the two arguments (the one on
the side being skipped) will be C<undef>.

To examine the context of the match, the C<weighter> method may invoke
any of the methods listed under L</Weighting utility methods>,
e.g. using C<backstep()> (possibly more than once) to examine the
context of the tokens being compared.

=item init()

Upon calling C<new()>, and before the actual alignment gets underway,
this class will call the C<init> method on itself (as an instance)
with all the hash arguments passed to C<new()>.

This provides an opportunity for the subclass to set any internal
configuration variables or do any other prep-work before the
polynomially-bound dynamic-programming algorithm gets underway.

If the subclass does not provide an implementation of C<init()>, a
null-operation implementation will be provided by (this) the base
class.

=back

=head2 Weighting utility methods

These methods are provided as hooks so that subclasses can cleanly
fulfil their end of the contract.  They are interfaces so that the
weighter can look back into the context of the alignment thus far.

They will probably I<not> behave correctly if invoked anywhere except
from within the C<weighter()> routine.

=over

=item backstep()

Retrieves, for the current weighting being considered, the previous
pairwise alignment (a match, substitution, insertion or deletion, as
returned from the C<pairwise()> method).

This method should only be invoked from within the C<weighter()>
function.  If it is called a second time, returns "the one before
that", etc.  Call the C<reset_backtrace()> method to begin again from
the token under consideration.

=item reset_backtrace()

Resets the state of the backtracing to the "pristine" state -- as it
was set when entering the C<weighter()> routine.

This method should only be invoked within the C<weighter()>
implementation.

=back

=head1 Methods provided

=head2 Class methods

The following methods may be called as class methods; e.g., in the
syntax:

  CLASSNAME->methodname();
  # assumes CLASSNAME is a descendant of Text::Align

These class methods are available to any subclass that fulfills the
contract.

=over

=item costs()

Arguments are:

  init-hash-ref, $left, @right

Calculates a series of distances (from C<$left> to each element in
C<@right>), using C<init-hash-ref> as the parameters with which to
initialize the C<Text::Alignment> object.

Arguments are defined as follows:

=over

=item init-hash-ref

Any arguments to be passed to the C<new()> method.  Each subclass may
require different initialization parameters; any additional parameters
required for initialization may be passed here.

=item $left

a scalar value or a reference to a list.  Will be passed as the
C<left> token to each of the C<Text::Alignment> objects constructed.

=item @right

a list of scalars or listrefs. Each of these will be compared to
C<$left>, and the resulting distance will be added to the list of
C<distances> to return.

=back

=item new()

constructs a new object of the subclass. Actually performs the
alignment and returns an object; instance methods on that object
access the results of the completed alignment.

Arguments are a set of key/value pairs including at least the
following:

=over

=item left  => (string or listref)

=item right => (string or listref)

The C<left> and C<right> keys are required. In each case, if the value
provided is a reference to a list, then that list is considered to be
"pre-split" and the elements provided will be used as the units.  If a
(non-reference) scalar is provided, it will be C<split> into separate
characters.

The two arguments (C<left> and C<right>) need not be the same datatype
-- one may be a listref, and the other a string, and all is well: the
string will be C<split>.

=back

See L</Instance methods> below for methods available from the object
returned from C<new()>.

=back

=head2 Instance methods

The following methods may be called on any instance of a
C<Text::Align> object, that is, the reference returned by calling
C<new()>.  Essentially, these methods make up the functionality
guaranteed to the subclass by the contract.

=over

=item pairwise()

Returns the alignment as a list of 2-element list references. Each
item in the list consists of a single pairwise alignment -- either an
insertion or a deletion in the alignment (in which case one element
will be C<undef>) or a match or substitution (both elements will be
present).

Takes no arguments.

=item cost()

Returns the total minimum cost of this alignment, as calculated during
the alignment step (which happened upon creation of the object).

Takes no arguments.

=item as_strings()

Returns the alignment as two strings of the same length, with C<pad>
characters (usually whitespace) and C<deleted> characters (usually
C<->) inserted where necessary so that aligned units share left edges.

If called in scalar context, will join the two strings with the
C<separator> character (usually C<\n>, see below). Optional arguments
include the following:

=over

=item join => JOINSTRING

The string that should separate tokens on output. Defaults to the
empty string (C<''>) if not provided.

=item pad => PADSTRING

The string with which to pad any segments of different
lengths. Default is a single (0x20) space (C< >) if not provided. Note
that any string you provide here must have a non-zero length (... of
course).

If the string you provide has a length larger than 1, then you run the
risk of it being ruthlessly C<chop>-ed

=item separator => SEPSTRING

The character with which to join the two strings when returning them
as a single text blob (scalar context). Defaults to a newline (C<\n>)
if not provided. Meaningless in list context.

=item deleted => DELSTRING

The character to use to represent a deleted (or inserted) character,
on the missing side. Note that the empty string (C<''>) is legal here,
which will most likely have the effect of using the C<pad> character
instead.  Defaults to a dash (C<->) if not provided.

=back

=item as_lists()

Returns 2 values representing the C<left> and C<right> lists of
alignments, with C<undef> values inserted opposite any skipped
tokens. Matching or substituted elements will be listed unchanged.

=back

=head2 EXPORT
