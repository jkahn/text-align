Text/Align version 0.01
=======================

This module is intended to be a base class for modules that intend to
experiment with the Ukkonen/Kruskal dynamic-programming algorithm for
alignment.

Derived classes shipped with this component include
Text::Align::Levenshtein and Text::Align::WagnerFischer, which are
intended as more configurable replacements for Text::Levenshtein and
Text::WagnerFischer. (The latter pair of modules do not allow the user
to examine the alignment resulting in the score).

This module allows the user to use alternate weightings, based on the
specific characters (or elements) being substituted, deleted or
inserted.

It also can apply to calculate alignments between arrays, if array
references are provided.
